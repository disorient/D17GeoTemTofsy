# Temple of Forbidden Symmetry

The Temple of Forbidden Symmetry (TOFSy) is an installation intended
for Burning Man 2017.  For more information on the project, see the
[Disorient Wiki](http://wiki.disorient.info/index.php?title=Geodesic_Temple#Temple_of_Forbidden_Symmetry_.28TFS.29_.28Burning_Man_2017.29)

The software relies on [Moonpaper](https://github.com/jacobjoaquin/Moonpaper) 
and borrows heavily from Jake's D15 code.

There are currently three components:

* Builder - Takes an OBJ exported from SketchUp and generates a JSON
file to be used with Moonpaper.

* Simulator - Provides an on screen simulation of the installation
that can be used to develop routines against

* Transmitter - Routines that are sent to the simulator or actual
installation.
